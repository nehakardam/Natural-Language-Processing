# Natural-Language-Processing
The goal of natural language processing (NLP) is to provide computers with the intelligence to process human language. Components of natural language processing are used in conversational agents and other systems that interact with humans, automatic translation between human languages, the automatic answering of questions using large text collections, the extraction of structured information from text, and numerous other applications. This course will educate you on the core concepts used by essential NLP components. It is divided into numerous "best hits" topics, each having a more or less self-contained lecture, readings, problems, and application exercises.
